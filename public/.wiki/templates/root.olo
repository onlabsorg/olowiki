This is the home page of your personal wiki. This page should contain an 
overview of its content and remand to the child documents for detailed content.

> and used to build this document, so you shouldn't duplicate content.

This page also contains some configuration data that you can use to customize 
the user interface of your wiki. Namely, that is:

* The `__title__` Text which defines the wiki title: its content will appear in 
  the browser tab and in the toolbar of the navigation pane.

* The `__toc__` List which defines the table of contents shown in the 
  navigation pane.

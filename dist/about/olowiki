# olowiki
Welcome to olowiki v<% __olowiki__.version %>!


### Get started

The content area renders the olo-document mapped to the `id` that follows the 
URL hash, which is also shown in the title bar. In the case of this document,
the doc-id should be `about:/olowiki`.

>  The store containing the `id -> document` mappings can be your [stilo]
>  repository (if you are running olowiki as stilo plugin), your browser
>  storage (if you are running the standalone olowiki version), or any
>  other type of storage if you are fetching from a custom olowiki server.

>  If the current document defines a `__title__` name, this will be displayed
>  in the title bar instead of the document path.

On the right of the title bar you can see two buttons: an `edit` button to
modify the source of the currently rendered document and a `save` button to
store the updated version of the document. Click edit and play with the source 
of this document and, when you are done, click on the `done` button (check mark)
to render it. 

>  If you try to save a modified version of this page, you will get an 
>  error message because this document is read-only. 

On the right side of this window you can find the store navigation tree, giving
you access to all the documents contained in the wiki store. By right-clicking
on it, you get a command menu that allows you to `open`, `add`, `duplicate` or
`download` a file or a directory. 

>  If you are using the standalone version of olowiki for the first time,
>  the navigation tree may be empty. In that case just `add` a new document 
>  and start editing it.

Finally, on the left of the title bar, there is the olowiki logo that opens
the document `about:/olowiki`.

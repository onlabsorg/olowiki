# Local Store

The documents under this path are stored locally in your browser, therefore they
are private and you have complete control over them. The downside is that they 
are not synchronized across your browsers.

You can start editing this document by clicking on the edit button on the
right-hand side bar or create new sub-documents by typing `local:/path/to/doc`
in the top bar.

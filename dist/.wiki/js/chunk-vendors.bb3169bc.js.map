reference to the router declaration above:\n *\n *  - `router.read('/path/to/store_1/path/to/doc')` will result in a call to\n *    `store_1.read('/path/to/doc')`\n *  - `router.read('/path/to/store_2/path/to/doc')` will result in a call to\n *    `store_2.read('/path/to/doc')`\n *  \n *  If no match is found, it will behave as empty store, which is: `read` will\n *  return an empty string, `write` and `delete` will throw a \n *  `WriteOperationNotAllowed` error.\n *  \n *  The constructor will ignore the properties of the `routes` object which are\n *  not valid stores (i.e. objects that do not have any of the methods\n *  `read`, `write` or `delete`).\n *  The easiest way to create a valid store is by extending the\n *  [Store](./store.md) class.\n *  \n *
